# FitLit Pair Project

A paired project during the second week of Module 2 at the Turing School of Software & Design.

By: Ashley McDonald, Tim Keresey


## Project Overview

In this project, we utilized test driven development to create a robust testing suite that was used to guide the implementation of code to create an object-oriented application. Technologies used included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Fonts, and ChartJS. Our functionality was tested using the Mocha framework and Chai Library. The application displays user data that was provided in the project spec through various hydration, sleep and activity metrics similar to most activity trackers.


## Installation and Setup

To view the application:
- after cloning the repo, in your terminal `run npm install`

To view the test suite:
  - run `npm test` in your terminal.
